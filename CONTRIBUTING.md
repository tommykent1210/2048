# Contributing
Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request.

Please follow the house rules to have a bigger chance of your contribution being merged.

## House rules

### How to make changes
 - To make changes, create a new branch based on `nightly` (do not create one from `gh-pages` unless strictly necessary) and make them there, then create a Pull Request to nightly.  
 `gh-pages` is different from nightly in that used gh-pages is used to generate the github site, whereas `nightly` contains the latest code. `master` is considered the "stable" version of the game.
 - Please test your modification thouroughly before submitting your Pull Request.

### Changes that might not be accepted
We have to be conservative with the core game. This means that some modifications won't be merged, or will have to be evaluated carefully before being merged. Only features in the roadmap that are `confirmed` future features will be accepted. Please open an issue thread with the tag set to `Feature Suggestion` to suggest a new feature.

### Changes that are welcome
 - Bug fixes
 - Compatibility improvements
 - "Under the hood" enhancements
 - Small changes that don't have an impact on the core gameplay
